# Mawusi-Baby-Step-In-Data-Analysis

# Project Name: Financial Data Analysis 

# Project Objective: To generate useful insights on the financial data accumulated between 2013 and 2014, and give recommendations based on these findings.

# Data Sourcing: Financial Data from Github

# Data Transformation: Data was cleaned, ensuring that empty spaces were removed. Pivot tables and charts were then created to visualize findings.  

# Findings: 2014 had highest discount and this resulted in higher sales. US had the highest monthly sales. Amarilla and VTT were the top 2 products with highest discount and conversely this led to their high sales. 

# Recommendation: More discount should be given to other countries. Other products should have discounted prices to promote their sales.
